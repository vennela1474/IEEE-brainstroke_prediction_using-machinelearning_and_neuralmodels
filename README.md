## 🔍 Abstract
This research paper explores and compares four machine learning and neural network models — **Random Forest**, **SVM**, **XGBoost**, and **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** — for predicting the risk of brain stroke using demographic, clinical, and lifestyle datasets. The study demonstrates that ensemble methods such as Random Forest and XGBoost outperform others, achieving accuracies of **94%** and **93%** respectively.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To assess the predictive power of various ML models in brain stroke diagnosis.
- To evaluate model performance using metrics like **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score**.
- To analyze feature importance and model interpretability in real-world medical use.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, NumPy, Pandas)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- ANN implemented via TensorFlow or Keras
- IEEE formatting via LaTeX
